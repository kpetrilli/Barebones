			<h3>Bony Showcase</h3>
			<p>Bony is pretty modern and fully responsive. As you might see, it scales up pretty well and feels clean. I think it is great for typography-oriented content.
				This includes manuals, for example.<br>
				This project originates from Dude's Skeleton CSS, quite some time ago. It has been left unmaintained, so Second Dude picked
				up and made his Barebones fork. I forked that one and included Third Dude's commits about :root element and and another one, for a total of two.</p>
			<blockquote>I mean, look at the typography: Doesnt' it give you an interior peace feeling?</blockquote>
